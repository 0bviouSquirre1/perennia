    Rooms are like any Object, except their location is None

    add locks so they cannot be puppeted or picked up.

        Displays the name of the object in a viewer-aware manner.

        Args:
            looker (TypedObject): The object or account that is looking
                at/getting inforamtion for this object. If not given, `.name` will be
                returned, which can in turn be used to display colored data.

        Returns:
            str: A name to display for this object. This can contain color codes and may
                be customized based on `looker`. By default this contains the `.key` of the object,
                followed by the DBREF if this user is privileged to control said object.

        Notes:
            This function could be extended to change how object names appear to users in character,
            but be wary. This function does not change an object's keys or aliases when searching,
            and is expected to produce something useful for builders.
