# Alpha Testers Please Read

First off, thank you for taking the time to test Perennia! It really takes a village to properly destroy a proof-of-concept, and that's what you're here to do. The HELP command will give you information on all the commands you should have access to. What I want from you:

- Broken commands
- Improper interactions between objects
- Anything it seems like you ought to be able to do but can't

Known errors:
WARNING -  Overwriting existing registered function stopWordFilter
Need to automatically select first available object when multiples
